# Caltech Course Planner
Course planner and degree audit. Uploaded is for CS option at Caltech. Can modify if_gen.py for other schools/options. Code is not documented so may be difficult to understand what you are doing.

Usage of the course planner is pretty self-explanatory (and there are examples in the file), but I'll explain it here:
  1. Find a course that you would like to take.
  2. Look up what requirement it will satisfy, and note the "classifier" that it fits into with the table on the right.
  3. Note how many units it is.
  4. Put it into the terms.

Let me know if you need any help, whether for CS option or adapting this to different options.
